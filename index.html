     <h3>The Sword of Damocles of China's Internet - Exploring the incident in which Netflix's Cat One Cup had its account permanently banned for producing a fake script
      </h3><br>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In February 2024, a web celebrity named Cat One Cup became famous overnight for producing and posting a video about picking up a Chinese middle school student's homework in Paris. The video, although full of humor and light-hearted banter, sparked widespread social discussion for its allegedly false information. CatCup later admitted that the content of the video was entirely fictitious, an act that not only led to her permanent ban, but also provoked the public to reflect deeply on online authenticity, legal boundaries, and media responsibility. This paper will explore the complex issues behind this incident, analyze the social impact of disinformation, and the possible long-term effects on online culture.

            <video src="images/1.mp4" controls loop autoplay muted>
            <br><p>&emsp;&emsp;On February 17, 2024, the KOL Cat Cup, who has a total of 40 million followers across multiple platforms, gained an extremely high number of views in a short period of time because of a short video she made about a Chinese junior high school boy's winter holiday homework she found in Paris, and according to statistics, she has gained 40w followers on tiktok because of the video. According to statistics, she gained 40w fans on tiktok for this video. A number of Chinese official media outlets followed up on the story.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The content of the video is about a cat who lives in France and says she found a Chinese junior high school student named Qin Lang's winter break homework on the street, and shouts at him online, hoping that he will come to collect his homework so that he won't be late to hand it in for the new semester. The content of the video does not contain any hate, violence, negative emotions, but only some flirting and quirky, however, because too many netizens are concerned about the junior high school student's follow-up, the cat cup had to send a video again to talk about the follow-up, saying that they have already obtained the contact information of the mother of "Qinlang" and are trying to think of a way to return the homework.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;However, the development of the matter exceeded everyone's expectations. Because some people reported the spread of false information, the cat a cup in April 12 released a very serious statement of apology, said the series of videos are all their own fabrication, for the dissemination of false information and apologize to the public. After the apology statement, the matter did not come to an end, but on April 13, the account of Cat One Cup was permanently banned by the whole platform, which means she can no longer appear in the public's vision.

            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Exploring the reasons why this video of a cat cup is so hot, one is that the winter and summer vacations are coming to an end, and the topics related to students' make-up homework on the Internet occupy a certain degree of heat, and the homework that one loses thousands of miles away from Paris is actually retrieved, and such a setup has increased the dramatic conflict, thus triggering a phenomenal discussion. Secondly, the retweeting and attention of some mainstream media expanded the influence and intensified the dissemination, which made many ordinary people believe in the authenticity of the content of this video and therefore paid more attention to it.

        <h3>While this sudden and severe penalty has shocked many, there are several questions worth exploring:</h3>
        <p>
            1. Should any content that gains a lot of attention because it is falsely curated be banned? Is what Netflix Cat One Cup did an isolated case?
        </p><br>
        <p>2. To a certain extent, moderately false content has the attribute of being widely disseminated and appealing to the public, while blanket blocking of the event because it is false, and treating excessive attention to the atmosphere of the online community, will it be overkill and stifle a large number of excellent original creators?
        </p><br>
        <p>
            3. It is worth noting that in the process of spreading the video of Cat One Cup, the official media did not verify the authenticity of the video before reprinting it and flirting with it, which is one of the aids to expanding the impact of the incident. When CatCup was penalized for faking the video and “consuming social resources”, should the official channel be penalized for its lack of rigour?

<p class="p2">&emsp;&emsp;Translated with DeepL.com (free version)In fact, the act of fabricating false information to gain traffic is commonplace on the Internet, and what really caused the public to discuss the incident was the fact that CatCup, which had not deliberately incited the public's emotions or provoked confrontation, was still sanctioned by the law. This has caused many people to panic because the law hangs over the heads of the masses like the sword of Damocles.</p>
<p class="p2">&emsp;&emsp;In this matter, the network public opinion on this attitude is also polarized: part of the people think that the cat a cup in the production of false video, and then sent a follow-up video response to the content, and this part of the response is also false, so the cat a cup of the practice is not worth advocating, which can only contribute to the network of false atmosphere of pomposity, her account is blocked is a positive measure, can be a wake-up call to the other KOLs. The other part thinks that since the cat has apologized, it should not be blocked again, after all, her video did not cause any adverse effects, and the video's wide dissemination and the official media to help attract traffic related, should not be so harsh punishment for her alone.
</p>
<p class="p2">&emsp;&emsp;The result of the cat cup incident is the whole network canceled accounts, however, the relevant discussion has not stopped, which is related to the official media should be punished for inaccurate reporting. At present, it seems that the official media reporting on this incident has not been subjected to appropriate control, perhaps in the future, we expect that the official can be more prudent to utilize the right of public opinion discourse, and better verify the authenticity of the time before reporting.
